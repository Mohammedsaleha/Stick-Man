The project is a game based on java. Beginning with an overview of the Java platform and language.
Then, set up a development environment and learn about its components. From there, learn basic Java

more we will make use of the platform to the maximum extent.
Java is a computer programming program that’s been around for a while. Java isn’t widely used in
video game development, but it is the main programming language used to make mobile Android
games. Web-based games also use Java, in conjunction with Flash.
